# Functions
# F(w, x)
Calculates the weighted sum of inputs.

# sigmoid(x)
Applies the sigmoid activation function.

# predict(model, x)
Predicts the output for a given input x using the trained model.

# calculate_accuracy(model, data)
Calculates the accuracy of the model on the provided data.

# Backpropagation(model, learning_rate, data, iterations)
Trains the model using the backpropagation algorithm.

# Training Data
The training data used in this implementation is based on the XOR problem:

python

Verify

# Open In Editor
Run
Copy code
data = [((0, 0), 0), ((0, 1), 1), ((1, 0), 1), ((1, 1), 0)]
The input consists of pairs of binary values, and the output is the corresponding binary result.

# Results
The model is trained for a specified number of iterations, and the accuracy is printed after each iteration. The final weights of the model are displayed at the end of the training process.

# Batch Version
A batch version of the backpropagation algorithm is also implemented, which processes multiple training examples simultaneously. This can improve training efficiency and convergence speed.
